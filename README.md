# Java_Projects

A growing collection of Java sample projects, exercises, and small utilities maintained by PranavSRM.

This repository collects standalone Java projects that demonstrate concepts, solve problems, or provide useful tools. New projects will be added over time — feel free to explore, run, learn from the code, and contribute.

## Repository status
- Primary language: Java (100%)
- Purpose: learning, demos, practice projects, and small utilities
- Current state: actively growing — more projects will be included in the upcoming times

## How this repo is organized
Each project in this repository should be self-contained in its own directory. A typical project layout looks like:

- project-name/
  - README.md            -> project-specific instructions and examples
  - src/                 -> source files (conventional package structure)
  - test/ or src/test/   -> tests (if included)
  - build files          -> `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle`/`gradlew` (Gradle) if used
  - resources/           -> additional runtime resources (optional)
  - .gitignore
  - LICENSE (optional)

Examples:
- PrimeNumberChecker/
- FileUtilsExample/
- DataStructuresDemo/

(Actual project directories will vary — check each project's README for exact instructions.)

## Requirements
- JDK 8+ (many projects will require at least Java 8; check each project's README for the exact required Java version)
- Maven or Gradle if the project includes build files (otherwise you can compile/run with javac/java)

## Building and running projects (general guidance)
If a project uses Maven:
- Build: mvn clean package
- Run (jar): java -jar target/<artifact>-<version>.jar
- Run (class): mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main" (if configured)

If a project uses Gradle:
- Build: ./gradlew build
- Run: ./gradlew run (if configured) or: java -jar build/libs/<project>.jar

If a project is plain source:
- Example compile:
  - javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")
- Example run:
  - java -cp out fully.qualified.MainClass

Always refer to the project-specific README for exact commands and runtime examples.

## Testing
- If a project includes tests (JUnit, TestNG, etc.), run them via the build tool:
  - Maven: mvn test
  - Gradle: ./gradlew test
- For plain projects, tests may be runnable with the same javac/java approach described above.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Suggested contribution workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch named feature/your-project-name or fix/issue-123.
3. Add your project in a new folder with a clear README explaining:
   - What the project does
   - How to build and run it
   - Java version and dependencies
   - Example usage and expected output
4. Add tests where appropriate.
5. Open a pull request with a clear title and description.

Please follow these conventions:
- Keep each project self-contained in its own top-level directory.
- Use conventional package names (e.g., io.pranav.projectname or com.github.pranavsrn.projectname).
- Add a license file to your project if you want to specify reuse terms.
- Write clear commit messages and a descriptive PR body.

If you want help picking an initial structure for a new project, open an issue or a draft PR and I can provide feedback.

## Issues and feature requests
Use the repository Issues page to report bugs, request new example projects, or propose enhancements. Include:
- A short title
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Java version and OS
- A minimal code sample or link to the project folder (if applicable)

## Roadmap
Planned additions (examples):
- Algorithms & data structures demos
- Small real-world utilities (file handling, network examples)
- GUI examples (JavaFX or Swing)
- Unit-testing and CI examples
- CLI tools

If you have suggestions for projects you'd like to see added, please open an issue.

## License
This repository does not include a top-level LICENSE file by default. If you want to set usage terms, please add a LICENSE file to the repository root (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.) or add one to individual project folders.
